# Turbine Power Prediction
A machine learning model with a data pipeline to capture, clean, extract, analyze, and store wind turbine data.
# Description
## Project Function
Currently companies are using formulas and linear analysis in attempts to model wind turbines, however have come up short due to the complexity of real world wind conditions. This project has attempted to take the data collected by the power curve working group, a member of the Consortium for the Advancement of Remote Sensing, and create a more realistic model of wind turbines.
## Power Curve Working Group Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis was the Power Curve Working Groups first dataset that comes from a moderately complex cold climate Swedish site surrounded by relatively low forestry. With values collected on approximately 10 minute intervals of mean wind speed and windvane at various heights as well as information on the turbine's density. The dataset contains over 10,000 examples spanning over a years worth of time and a total of 28 features.
