# Turbine Power Prediction
A machine learning model with a data pipeline to capture, clean, extract, analyze, and store wind turbine data.
# Description
## Project Function
Currently companies are using formulas and linear analysis in attempts to model wind turbines, however have come up short due to the complexity of real world wind conditions. This project has attempted to take the data collected by the power curve working group, a member of the Consortium for the Advancement of Remote Sensing, and create a more realistic model of wind turbines.
## Power Curve Working Group Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis was the Power Curve Working Groups first dataset that comes from a moderately complex cold climate Swedish site surrounded by relatively low forestry. With values collected on approximately 10 minute intervals of mean wind speed and windvane at various heights as well as information on the turbine's density. The dataset contains over 10,000 examples spanning over a years worth of time and a total of 28 features.
## Pipeline Architecture

I utilized a batch ingestion pipeline, collecting the raw data with python and stored it within a data lake with AWS S3. I then used pandas a python library to transform the data, removing missing and outlier data points. Storing this clean data in a data warehouse in AWS S3. Next, I used scikit-learn a python library to extract features and run a machine learning model on the data. I collected the results from the machine learning forecasting as well as the cleaned data from the warehouse and created data visualizations within Tableau.

## Data Provence
The dataset the owners of the dataset is the power curve working group who collected the data from a wind turbine site in Sweden. It has not been documented how exactly the data has been processed outside of a blanket statement of a standard filtering system. The data has been changed over time with eight revisions to the dataset being made by the same individual. He has listed what was done each time to document the changes such as adding new columns and fixing missing values. The initial seven changes were made between 2013 to 2014; however, the fixing of missing values was done in 2024. The changes made are specified as pulling data from other public datasets to expand this specific dataset. I do trust this data as only one individual has manipulated the data since it has been published with detailed explanations as to what was changed and when. The values themselves are also being collected with LiDAR which a more accurate system than other alternatives thus giving more confidence to the accuracy of the values. Going over the data provenance questions, anyone can access a copy of this dataset by going to their website, but to make edits to the data it only is those who work for the group. The security to protect the data and privacy are not allowing people to access or manipulate the data at the source. There are not a lot of privacy protection being used as the data is not pertaining to personal or health information, however the exact location it was collected was not disclosed. As the previous versions and the actual documentation of changes outside of the self-reported revisions are not available I would say the data is not compliant with new regulations. The data source I am using would not be approved for use in a company as there is not enough documentation as to revisions and authenticity of the data, but for a research project on the capabilities of machine learning to predict power generated from wind turbines without having access to our own wind turbines this may be the best option.
## Data Transformation Models
Briefly describe the transformations and models used and final results that you were able to achieve. If there are any special instructions needed to execute your code (e.g., signing up to a specific API to access the dataset that is needed) those need to be listed as well.
